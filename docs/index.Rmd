I am a student at University of Texas at Austin studying statistics and
data science and also receiving a certificate in programming and
computation along with a minor in sociology. I am twenty one years old,
an aunt, and a dog lover. I enjoy listening to music, journaling,
running, reading, and watching movies in my free time.

My favorites movies currently:

-   Bottoms
-   Aftersun
-   Juno
-   Donnie Darko
